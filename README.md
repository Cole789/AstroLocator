AstroLocator is a Python program designed to compute and display the positions of planets and other celestial objects. It offers a user-friendly console interface to interact with various astronomical data.

## Features

- **Planetary Position Calculation**: Computes the azimuth and altitude positions of planets in the solar system.
- **Celestial Data**: Retrieves and displays additional data about planets and other celestial objects.
- **Interactive Console UI**: Provides an intuitive and navigable console-based user interface.

## Development Plans
- This program is intended to be used as the backend to calculate the degrees that a motorized machine will have to rotate to point an object towards a particular celestial object.
